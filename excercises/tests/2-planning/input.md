Plan and implement an enhancement to the legacy testing SPEC of the application under test.

As ToDo item is a repetitive object, let's introduce a simple Component Object for it in the @excercises/tests/2-planning folder

Implementation Plan:
- Create a simple Component Object class for the ToDo item, follow the guidelines presented in the Playwright documentation @https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures#creating-a-fixture
- Create a Test Spec that Covers Creation functionality of the ToDo item using the Component Object
- Test coverage cases should include the same functionality as the legacy tests
- All the tests in the new spec file should pass.
